Japanese Miso Soup
Yields 4 to 6 servings

Miso soup making can be a tricky business; here is a simple and scrumptious version from one of my college friends who is originally from Japan. I’ve added the bok choy, carrots, and mushrooms to make the soup even more filling, delicious, and nutritious. 

4 golden potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 sticks of Kombu sea vegetable (for broth) or 8 cups of oil-free vegetable broth
8 cups of boiling water (only if using Kombu) 
1 yellow onion, cut into chunks
2 carrots peeled and grated
1 bunch of bok choy, cut into strips
10 sliced cremini mushrooms
1 handful of cut dried seaweed (nori)
1 to 5 tablespoons of brown, yellow, or red miso
3-5 branches of scallions, chopped

1. Rinse the potatoes with cold water and soak with hot water for five minutes to avoid foam. 
2. In a large pot, boil the Kombu in the 8 cups of water for four minutes or as directed by the Kombu packaging. Remove the Kombu after the four minutes.
a. If using 8 cups of vegetable broth, bring to a boil. 
3. Add potatoes and onions. Simmer until the potatoes are soft. 
4. Add grated carrots, bok choy, and mushrooms and simmer for 5 more minutes or until the bok choy is slightly cooked. 
5. Add dry seaweed and remove the soup from the heat. 
6. Using a ladle or deep spoon, scoop up some of the broth and add 1 tablespoon of miso to the ladle. Stir the mixture in the ladle with a small spoon until it dissolves. Once the miso has dissolved in the ladle, add it to the rest of the soup. Continue until the soup tastes miso-e enough for you.
7. Add scallions.
8. Re-heat soup just enough so that it’s warm but does not boil. 
9. Serve and eat. Slurp enthusiastically!
